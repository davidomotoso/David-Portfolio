        <h1>How I got into Frontend Engineering</h1>

        <div class="journey">
          <p>
            I had just applied for a Frontend Engineering internship program at
            Terra, despite having little prior experience with it. Previously, I
            had been coding in Python as a beginner, but I was drawn to the
            visually stunning websites created by Frontend Engineers. I was
            excited about this opportunity and don't regret my decision to
            pursue it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to research on the languages I needed for the program then I
            stumbled upon freeCodeCamp.

            <h1>
              <a
                href="https://freecodecamp.org"

                >FreeCodeCamp</a
              >
            </h1>
            <p>
              I'm a big fan of the way freeCodeCamp structures their curriculum.
              One of my favorite features is being able to view my coding
              results on the side while I'm working. The instructions and
              examples provided are simplified, making it easier to follow
              along. Through freeCodeCamp, I was able to learn HTML and CSS, and
              I'm currently still learning JavaScript. I highly recommend
              freeCodeCamp for anyone looking to venture into software
              engineering.

              Terra provides an excellent opportunity to learn new skills and
              gain experience in various industries. The flexible curriculum
              allows you to work at your own pace and schedule. The program is
              divided into a month-long learning phase followed by a boot camp
              stage, where you'll collaborate on projects with other team
              members. The experience I gained from this organization was
              invaluable, helping me build my career path and improve my
              teamwork and communication skills.

            While searching for online tutorials on JavaScript, I stumbled upon
            Netninja's playlist on the subject. At first, I was hesitant, but as
            I progressed, my JavaScript skills improved significantly. Netninja
            is an excellent teacher, and his tutorials on YouTube cover various
            programming languages. If you're just starting with JavaScript, I
            highly recommend checking out Netninja's tutorials on YouTube.
